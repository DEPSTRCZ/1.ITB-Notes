Hi Vašek,

do you remember me? We were in the same class back in first and second grade, after that you moved away and it's been a long time since we last saw each other. Now we're both in high school, and I was curious about how you're doing.

How's high school going for you? What are your favorite classes? What do you want to do after you graduate? Have you made any new friends? For me it's been nice, I like my new school and hope you do too. I'm currently studying IT and I like it very much!

I remember you as a smart, and fun person, and I would like to catch up and hear about what you've been up to since we last saw each other. Maybe we can chat over video call or even meet up in person if we're in the same area.

I hope you're doing well, and I hope to hear from you soon!

Take care Vašek,
Vojtěch
